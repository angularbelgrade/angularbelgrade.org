    talkDescription:
      'Zone.js has been a core part of Angular’s change detection for years. At the same time, it introduces real trade-offs: more challenging debugging, unpredictable performance, increased bundle size, and additional runtime overhead.<br/><br/>In this talk, we’ll start by examining the price we pay for using Zone.js and what practical benefits zoneless mode brings in return: improved performance characteristics, a clearer mental model, and an enhanced developer experience.<br/><br/>After that, we’ll take a short look under the hood of Angular’s zoneless mode. You’ll see how Angular triggers change detection without Zone.js, the role of the ChangeDetectionScheduler, and how the framework knows which exact parts of your application view need to update.<br/><br/>By the end of the talk, you’ll have a clear understanding of why zoneless exists, how it works at a high level, and what changes for you as an Angular developer.',

We’ll focus on developer ergonomics for ephemeral UI tasks like notification summarization, generative UI chat, natural language form inputs, and inline content transformations. Through concrete examples and real code, you’ll see how browser-native agents enable faster iteration, tighter UI feedback loops, and new interaction patterns that are difficult to express in traditional server-first agent architectures.',

But the rise of LLMs is fundamentally shifting the user\'s expectation from "finding a feature" to "executing an intent."<br/><br/>In this keynote, we will explore the transition toward a world where user interfaces are no longer hard-coded, but are instead fluid, on-demand, and constructed in real-time to match a user’s specific goal. We will discuss why the next generation of applications won\'t just "have AI features," but will be built on an entirely different architectural foundation. Crucially, we’ll look at how we must evolve our API and DSL designs today to ensure they are "LLM-first," acting as the bridge between raw model power and a seamless user experience. It\'s time to stop building static maps and start architecting for the era of intent.',

    talkDescription:
      "Modern Angular applications grow quickly, and with that growth come new questions about how to structure and share state effectively. Signals make local state simple and expressive, but as applications evolve, architectural decisions around state become increasingly important.<br/><br/>In this talk, we go beyond the basics of the NgRx Signal Store and explore how it can be used as an architectural building block in real Angular applications. We look at practical scenarios and discuss where state belongs, how to define clear boundaries between components, features, and application wide concerns, and how Signal Store fits into that picture.<br/><br/>We dive deeper into advanced Signal Store concepts such as store composition, derived state, effects, and integration with Angular's dependency injection system, always from an architectural point of view rather than focusing only on the API.<br/><br/>This session is driven by experience and clear opinions. It focuses on sharing patterns, heuristics, and mental models that help teams structure state with confidence. You will leave with concrete ideas for designing maintainable and scalable Angular applications using Signal Store, grounded in real world constraints and everyday development.",
