At Celonis, we have more than 26 apps and close to 100 libs, with more than 100k lines of code, and we had the same challenge.<br/><br/>Strict mode brings more type-checking to the code base, which means delivering apps with more confidence.<br/><br/>In this talk, I will share how we incrementally planned our migration so we don't block the entire team, only doing the strict mode migration and delivering once they have a resource.<br/><br/>So join me in this lightning talk and move your apps towards strict mode.",
